Alan Turing, the pioneering Computer Scientist and World War II codebreaker, has a statue in Sackville Gardens in Manchester. On 23rd June each year, we surround it with flowers in his memory for his birthday. Since 2013, we've raised over Â£5,600 for the amazing charity [Special Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpYNG7MivHs&feature=emb_title)!

We've been running this event since 2013, here are the reports from previous years. Feel free to have a browse: they are a mix of heartwarming messages and much less heartwarming accounting details.
