So, this is what Alan Turing’s statue looked like on his birthday!

You did this, once again you came together and did this, and you raised  <span class="format-number">{{page.total}}</span> for Special Effect.

We had donations from all of these places!

## Accounting!
{% assign paypal = 1482.98 %}
Okay, the accounting part:

There were 59 (compared to 43 last year!) donations through the website for a total of £1532.00  or <span class="format-number">{{paypal}}</span> after fees. 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.year}}/paypal.png" alt="Screenshot of Paypal" width=100px />

There were two separate large donations. One was £2,500 and one was £2,000.  They went directly to Special Effect (we direct all particularly large donations directly to Special Effect because of things like PayPal fees and GiftAid). 

That's a total amount raised of <span class="format-number">{{page.total}}</span> for Special Effect and The Open Voice Factory

I made an annoying mistake when setting up the event. I wrote: "Donations are made up of £3.50 to cover the cost of the flowers, a £13 charity contribution to Special Effect, and a £3 charity contribution to the server costs of The Open Voice Factory for a total of £18.50.". 

There's a lot wrong with that - 

* the total would add up to £19.50, not £18.50. 
* it's not clear how to split the money if the flowers cost a different amount 
* it's not clear how to split the money if people donate a different amount. 
* it's unclear if we split the total amount raised including large private donations or if we just split the PayPal ones. 
* on Reddit, I'd said "20% goes to Open Voice Factory", but 3 out of 16 is 18.75% 

In the end I left the large donations as they were and split the PayPal donations after expenses in the ratio 13:3. That of course means that much less went to The Open Voice Factory than one might could have expected, but it seemed like the way that was most accurate to what had been written on the donation page.   

So that means... 

{% assign tot_expenses = 187.5 %}
{% assign last_transfer = paypal | minus: tot_expenses %}
{% assign special_effect_share = last_transfer | times: 0.85 %}
{% assign open_voice_factory_share = last_transfer | times: 0.15 %}


*   The flowers cost <span class="format-number">{{tot_expenses}}</span>, which was slightly below the budgeted amount. The receipts are [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.year}}/receipts.zip). 
*   This leaves <span class="format-number">{{last_transfer}}</span> to transfer after expenses.

*   13 parts of 16 is £1,052.58 which will be transferred to Special Effect.
*   3 parts of 16 is £242.89 which go to pay for the Open Voice Factory Server costs.

Now, unfortunately I am an idiot and transferred the wrong amount to Special Effect and then had to ask for the overpay back (this is one of the more embarrassing emails I've ever had to write) so there are two screenshots for this: 


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.year}}/out.png" alt="Sending too much money out" width=100px />
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.year}}/back.png" alt="Being sent the overpay back" width=100px />

Hopefully donors can feel sure that their money went to the right place (eventually).
