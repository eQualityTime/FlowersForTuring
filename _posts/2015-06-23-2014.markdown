So this is what Alan Turing’s statue looked for  his birthday:

Our rough total amount of donations came in at £720, which with £68 spent on flowers.  Meaning we have raised about £650 for Special Effect, beating last year’s total by about 50%!

The flowers themselves look considerably better this year – full credit to, as it happens, my mum and dad for buying, fetching, arranging and generally sorting them.
