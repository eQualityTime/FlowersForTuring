## Accounting!
Okay, the accounting part:

There were 57  donations through the website for a total of £2,914.05. The mean donation was £51.12, but that is skewed by a couple of larger donations.

*   Flowers and mileage expenses were £205, which was slightly below the budgeted amount.\. The receipts are [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.year}}/flowers.pdf)
*   This leaves {{page.total}} to transfer to Special Effect. 
*   The Pay Pal account was withdrawn to eQuality Time's Unity Bank account and from there transferred to Special Effect. 

Hopefully donors can feel sure that their money went to the right place. The relevant transactions from the [eQuality Time](https://equalitytime.co.uk/) account will be added as soon as they are approved by trustees.
