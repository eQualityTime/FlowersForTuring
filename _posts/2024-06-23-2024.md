So, this is what Alan Turing’s Status looked like on their birthday!

## Accounting!
{% assign paypal = 2880.42 %}
Okay, the accounting part:

There were 43 (compared to 108 last year!) donations through the website for a total of £2,516.31 or <span class="format-number">{{paypal}}</span> after fees. 
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.year}}/paypal.png" alt="Screenshot of Paypal" width=100px />
This year there were no donations outside of the website. 

That's a total amount raised of <span class="format-number">{{page.total}}</span> for Special Effect and The Open Voice Factory

{% assign tot_expenses = 193.69 %}
{% assign last_transfer = paypal | minus: tot_expenses %}
{% assign special_effect_share = last_transfer | times: 0.85 %}
{% assign open_voice_factory_share = last_transfer | times: 0.15 %}

*   Flowers and mileage expenses were <span class="format-number">{{tot_expenses}}</span>, which was slightly below the budgeted amount. The receipts are [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/{{page.year}}/receipts.zip). 
*   This leaves <span class="format-number">{{last_transfer}}</span> to transfer after expenses.
*   85% (<span class="format-number">{{special_effect_share}}</span>) will be transferred to Special Effect.
*   15% (<span class="format-number">{{open_voice_factory_share}}</span>) will be transferred to The Open Voice Factory.
*   The Pay Pal account was withdrawn to eQuality Time's Unity Bank account and from there was transferred out

Hopefully donors can feel sure that their money went to the right place. The relevant transactions from the [eQuality Time](https://equalitytime.co.uk/) account will be added as soon as they are approved by trustees.
