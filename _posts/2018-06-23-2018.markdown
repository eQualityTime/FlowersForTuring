So this is what Alan Turing’s Statue looked like this past weekend for his birthday:

Photo is by Lucy Milson-Watkins of Historic England, who turned up to document this event for an exhibition they are running. We also [turned up in the press](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/alan-turing-statue-manchester-flowers-14820204) this year.

You did this. All of you.  You raised a little over £1,600 for special effect, which will go to improving peoples lives.

Thank you all so much.  You are amazing.

## Accounting! 

Okay, the boring accounting part:

*   We were approached by a private donor, who, at our advice, sent £1,000 to special effect. We remain staggered by this.
*   [The Paypal pool](http://paypal.me/pools/c/83f5W4qZXG) raised £624.50 (there were some corrections around this – for example some people couldn’t access the pool, they transferred money to me, and then my girlfriend put the relevant money into the pool with a note, but those were small acts to make sure the amount was accurate.
*   There were then two large purchases of flowers, one of 59.66 and one of 34.84, for a total of £94.50.  The receipts are below.
*   This leaves exactly £530 to transfer to special effect. Screenshot below.
