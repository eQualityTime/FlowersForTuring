Alan Turing, the pioneering Computer Scientist and World War II codebreaker, has a statue in Sackville Gardens in Manchester. On 23rd June each year, we surround it with flowers in his memory for his birthday.

This started in 2013, like many things, as a small gesture, and since then has grown to be a modest charity event raising over £5,600 for the amazing charity Special Effect!
