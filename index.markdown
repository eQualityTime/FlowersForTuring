Alan Turing, the pioneering Computer Scientist and World War II codebreaker, has a statue in Sackville Gardens in Manchester. On 23rd June each year, we surround it with flowers in his memory for his birthday. Since 2013, we've raised over Â£7,600 for the amazing [Special Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpYNG7MivHs&feature=emb_title), which is a UK based charity which uses video games and technology to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities.

THE FLOWERS FOR 2021 HAVE NOW BEEN PURCHASED AND PUT ON THE STATUE! The year's report will be written up shortly. Any donations made today will be passed to special effect with the rest of the funds, but the actual flowers will go on the list for next year :) 

* To pledge a bunch of flowers, click [here](donate.html)
* To find out more about the event, try our [FAQ](faq.html), or one of our [reports](reports.html).
