Alan Turing, the pioneering Computer Scientist and World War II codebreaker, has a statue in Sackville Gardens in Manchester. On 23rd June each year, we surround it with flowers in his memory for his birthday. Since 2013, we've raised over £5,600 for the amazing charity Special Effect!

If you’d like to know where the money goes – here’s a [handy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpYNG7MivHs&feature=emb_title) from Special Effect.
