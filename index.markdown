Alan Turing, the pioneering Computer Scientist and World War II codebreaker, has a statue in Sackville Gardens in Manchester. On 23rd June each year, we surround it with flowers in his memory for his birthday. Since 2013, we've raised over Â£12,700 for the amazing [Special Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpYNG7MivHs&feature=emb_title), which is a UK based charity which uses video games and technology to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities.


* To find out more about the event, try our [FAQ](faq.html), or one of our [reports](reports.html).
